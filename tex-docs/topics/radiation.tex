\section{Radiation}
\subsection{The First Law of Thermodynamics and the Stefan-Boltzmann Equation}
The beginning of CLAuDE is based upon one of the most important laws of physics: "Energy is neither created nor destroyed, only changed from one form to another." In otherwords, if energy goes 
into an object it must equal the outflowing energy plus the change of internal energy. This is captured in Stefan-Boltzmann's law (\autoref{eq:stefan-boltzmann}) \cite{stefan-boltzmann}. 

Here we assume that the planet is a black body, i.e. it absorbs all radiation (energy waves, some waves are visible like light, others are invisible like radio signals) on all wavelengths. 
In \autoref{eq:stefan-boltzmann} the symbols are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$: The energy that reaches the top of the atmosphere, coming from the sun or a similar star, per second per meters squared $Wm^{-2}$. This is also called the insolation.
    \item $\sigma$: The Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $5.670373 \cdot 10^-8 \ (Wm^{-2}K^{-4})$ \cite{stefan-boltzmann}.
    \item $T$: The temperature of the planet ($K$).
\end{itemize}

The energy difference between the energy that reaches the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet must be equal to the change in temperature of the planet, which is written in 
\autoref{eq:sb rewritten}. The symbols on the right hand side are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta U$: The change of internal energy ($J$) \cite{thermo1}.
    \item $C$: The specific heat capacity of the object, i.e. how much energy is required to heat the object by one degree Kelvin ($\frac{J}{K}$).
    \item $\Delta T$: The change in temperature ($K$).
\end{itemize}

We want to know the change of temperature $\Delta T$, so we rewrite the equation into \autoref{eq:sb rewritten2}. Here we added the $\delta t$ term to account for the time difference (or time 
step). This is needed as we need an interval to calculate the difference in temperature over. Also we need to get the energy that we get ($J$) and not the energy per second ($W$), and by adding 
this time step the units all match up perfectly.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        S = SB = \sigma T^4
        \label{eq:stefan-boltzmann}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        S - \sigma T^4 = \Delta U = C \Delta T
        \label{eq:sb rewritten}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta T = \frac{\delta t(S - \sigma T^4)}{C}
        \label{eq:sb rewritten2}
    \end{equation}
    \label{eq:basis}
\end{subequations}

The set of equations in \autoref{eq:basis} form the basis of the temperature exchange of the planet. However two crucial aspects are missing. Only half of the planet will be receiving light from 
the sun at once, and the planet is a sphere. So we need to account for both in our equation. We do that in \autoref{eq:basis sphere correction}. We view the energy reacing the atmosphere as a 
circular area of energy, with the equation for the are of a circle being \autoref{eq:basis circle} \cite{areaCircle}. The area of a sphere is in \autoref{eq:basis sphere} \cite{areaSphere}. In 
both equations, $r$ is the radius of the circle/sphere. By using \autoref{eq:basis circle} and \autoref{eq:basis sphere} in \autoref{eq:sb rewritten2} we get \autoref{eq:basis sphere2} where 
$r$ is replaced by $R$. It is common in physics literature to use capitals for large objects like planets. However we are not done yet since we can divide some stuff out. We end up with 
\autoref{eq:basis sphere final} as the final equation we are going to use.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \pi r^2
        \label{eq:basis circle}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        4 \pi r^2
        \label{eq:basis sphere}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta T = \frac{\delta t (\pi R^2S - 4\pi R^2\sigma T^4)}{4\pi CR^2}
        \label{eq:basis sphere2}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta T = \frac{\delta t (S - 4\sigma T^4)}{4C}
        \label{eq:basis sphere final}
    \end{equation}
    \label{eq:basis sphere correction}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Insolation}

With the current equation we calculate the global average surface temperature of the planet itself. However, this planet does not have an atmosphere just yet. Basically we modelled the 
temperature of a rock floating in space, let's change that with \autoref{eq:atmos}. Here we assume that the area of the atmosphere is equal to the area of the planet surface. Obviously
this assumption is false, as the atmosphere is a sphere that is larger in radius than the planet, however the difference is not significant enough to account for it. We also define the
atmosphere as a single layer. This is due to the accessibility of the model, we want to make it accessible, not university simulation grade. One thing to take into account for the 
atmosphere is that it only partially absorbs energy. The sun (or a similar star) is relatively hot and sends out energy waves (radiation) with relatively low wavelengths. The planet is 
relatively cold and sends out energy at long wavelengths. As a side note, all objects radiate energy. You can verify this by leaving something in the sun on a hot day for a while and 
almost touch it later. You can feel the heat radiating from the object. The planet is no exception and radiates heat as well, though at a different wavelength than the sun. The 
atmosphere absorbs longer wavelengths better than short wavelengths. For simplicity's sake we say that all of the sun's energy does not get absorbed by the atmosphere. The planet's 
radiation will be absorbed partially by the atmosphere. Some of the energy that the atmosphere absorbs is radiated into space and some of that energy is radiated back onto the planet's 
surface. We need to adjust \autoref{eq:basis sphere final} to account for the energy being radiated from the atmosphere back at the planet surface.

So let us denote the temperature of the planet surface as $T_p$ and the temperature of the atmosphere as $T_a$. Let us also write the specific heat capacity of the planet surface as $C_p$ 
instead of $C$. We add the term in \autoref{eq:atmos on surface improved} to \autoref{eq:basis sphere final} in \autoref{eq:surface change}. In \autoref{eq:atmos on surface}, $\epsilon$ is the 
absorbtivity of the atmosphere, the fraction of energy that the atmosphere absorbs. We divided \autoref{eq:atmos on surface} by $\pi R^2$ as we did that with \autoref{eq:basis sphere final} as 
well, so we needed to make it match that division.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        4\pi R^2 \epsilon \sigma T_a^4
        \label{eq:atmos on surface}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        4\epsilon \sigma T_a^4
        \label{eq:atmos on surface improved}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta T_p = \frac{\delta t (S + 4\epsilon \sigma T_a^4 - 4\sigma T_p^4)}{4C_p}
        \label{eq:surface change}
    \end{equation}
    \label{eq:atmos}
\end{subequations}

As you probably expected, the atmosphere can change in temperature as well. This is modelled by \autoref{eq:atmos change}, which is very similar to \autoref{eq:surface change}. There are
some key differences though. Instead of subtracting the radiated heat of the atmosphere once we do it twice. This is because the atmosphere radiates heat into space and towards the 
surface of the planet, which are two outgoing streams of energy instead of one for the planet (as the planet obviously cannot radiate energy anywhere else than into the atmosphere).
$C_a$ is the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere.

\begin{equation}
    \Delta T_a = \frac{\delta t (\sigma T_p^4 - 2\epsilon\sigma T_a^4)}{C_a}
    \label{eq:atmos change}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Latitude Longitude Grid}
With the current model, we only calculate the global average temperature. To calculate the temperature change along the surface and atmosphere at different points, we are going to use a grid.
Fortunately the world has already defined such a grid for us, the latitude longitude grid \cite{latlong}. The latitude is the coordinate running from the south pole to the north pole, with -90 
being the south pole and 90 being the north pole. The longitude runs parallel to the equator and runs from 0 to 360 which is the amount of degrees that an angle can take when calculating the 
angle of a circle. So 0 degrees longitude is the same place as 360 degrees longitude. To do this however we need to move on from mathematical formulae to code (or in this case pseudocode).

Pseudocode is a representation of real code. It is meant to be an abstraction of code such that it does not matter how you present it, but every coder should be able to read it and implement 
it in their language of preference. This is usually easier to read than normal code, but more difficult to read than mathematical formulae. If you are unfamiliar with code or coding, look up 
a tutorial online as there are numerous great ones.

The pseudocode in \autoref{alg:stream1v1} defines the main function of the radiation part of the model. All values are initialised beforehand, based on either estimations, trial and error or 
because they are what they are (like the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma$), which is all done in \autoref{sec:cp}. The total time $t$ starts at 0 and increases by $\delta t$ after every 
update of the temperature. This is to account for the total time that the model has simulated (and it is also used later). What you may notice is the $T_p[lan, lon]$ notation. This is to indicate 
that $T_p$ saves a value for each $lan$ and $lon$ combination. It is initialised as all zeroes for each index pair, and the values is changed based on the calculations. You can view $T_p$ like 
the whole latitude longitude grid, where $T_p[lat, lon]$ is an individual cell of that grid indexed by a specific latitude longitude combination. Do note that from here on most, if not all
functions need to be called \footnote{In case you are unfamiliar with calls, defining a function is defining how it works and calling a function is actually using it.} from another file which I 
will call the master. The master file decides what parts of the model to use, what information it uses for plots and the like. We do it this way because we want to be able to switch out 
calculations. Say that I find a more efficient way, or more detailed way, to calculate the temperature change. If everything was in one file, then I need to edit the source code of the project.
With the master file structure, I can just swap out the reference to the project's implementation with a reference to my own implementation. This makes the life of the user (in this case the 
programmer who has another implementation) easier and makes changing calculations in the future easier as well. Also note that what we pass on as parameters \footnote{Parameters are variables 
that a function can use but are defined elsewhere. The real values of the variables are passed on to the funciton in the call.} in \autoref{alg:stream1v1} are the 
things that change during the execution of the model or that are calculated beforehand and not constants. $S$ for instance is not constant (well at this point it is but in \autoref{sec:daynight} 
we change that) amd the current time is obviously not constant. All constants can be found in \autoref{sec:cp}.

        }
    }

\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Day/Night Cycle} \label{sec:daynight}
As you can see, the amount of energy that reaches the atmopsphere is constant. However this varies based on the position of the sun relative to the planet. To fix this, we have to assign a 
function to $S$ that gives the correct amount of energy that lands on that part of the planet surface. This is done in \autoref{alg:solar}. In this algorithm the term insolation is mentioned, 
which is $S$ used in the previous formulae if you recall. We use the $\cos$ function here to map the strength of the sun to a number between $0$ and $1$. The strength is dependent on the latitude, 
but since that is in degrees and we need it in radians we transform it to radians by multiplying it by $\frac{\pi}{180}$. This function assumes the sun is at the equinox (center of the sun is 
directly above the equator) \cite{equinox} at at all times. The second $\cos$ is needed to simulate the longitude that the sun has moved over the longitude of the equator. For that we need the 
difference between the longitude of the point we want to calculate the energy for, and the longitude of the sun. The longitude of the sun is of course linked to the current time (as the sun is 
in a different position at 5:00 than at 15:00). So we need to map the current time in seconds to the interval $[0,$ seconds in a day$]$. Therefore we need the mod function. The mod function 
works like this: $x$ mod $y$ means subtract all multiples of $y$ from $x$ such that $0 \leq x < y$. So to map the current time to a time within one day, we do $-t$ mod $d$ where $-t$ is the 
current time and $d$ is the amount of seconds in a day. We need $-t$ as this ensures that the sun moves in the right direction, with $t$ the sun would move in the opposite direction in our model 
than how it would move in real life. When we did the calculation specified in \autoref{alg:solar} we return the final value (which means that the function call is "replaced" 
\footnote{Replaced is not necessarily the right word, it is more like a mathematical function $f(x)$ where $y = f(x)$. You give it an $x$ and the value that correpsonds to that $x$ is saved in 
$y$. So you can view the function call in pseudocode as a value that is calculated by a different function which is then used like a regular number.} by the value that the function calculates). 
If the final value is less than 0, we need to return 0 as the sun cannot suck energy out of the planet (that it does not radiate itself, which would happen if a negative value is returned).

\end{algorithm}

By implementing \autoref{alg:solar}, \autoref{alg:stream1v1} must be changed as well, as $S$ is no longer constant for the whole planet surface. So let us do that in \autoref{alg:stream1v2}. Note 
that $S$ is defined as the call to \autoref{alg:solar}.
