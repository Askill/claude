\section{History of the Algorithms} \label{sec:history}
Back when I was a young naive programmer, I made a thing. Now a few years down the line I made the thing again, but infinitely better. So I have no use for the old thing anymore. But fear not,
old algorithms (used by CLAuDE) will be collected here. This is just for historical purposes.

\subsubsection{The Primitive Equations and Geostrophy}
The primitive equations (also known as the momentum equations) is what makes the air move. It is actually kind of an injoke between physicists as they are called the primitive equations but 
actually look quite complicated (and it says $fu$ at the end! \cite{simon}). The primitive equations are a set of equations dictating the direction in the $u$ and $v$ directions as shown in 
\autoref{eq:primitive u} and \autoref{eq:primitive v}. We can make the equations simpler by using and approximation called geostrophy which means that we have no vertical motion, such that the
terms with $\omega$ in \autoref{eq:primitive u} and \autoref{eq:primitive v} become 0. We also assume that we are in a steady state, i.e. there is no acceleration which in turn means that the 
whole middle part of the equations are $0$. Hence we are left with \autoref{eq:primitive u final} and \autoref{eq:primitive v final}.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{du}{dt} = \frac{\delta u}{\delta t} + u\frac{\delta u}{ \delta x} + v\frac{\delta u}{\delta v} + \omega\frac{\delta u}{\delta p} = -\frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta x} + fv
        \label{eq:primitive u}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{\delta v}{\delta t} + u\frac{\delta v}{ \delta x} + v\frac{\delta v}{\delta v} + \omega\frac{\delta v}{\delta p} = -\frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta y} - fu
        \label{eq:primitive v}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        0 = -\frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta x} + fv
        \label{eq:primitive u final}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        0 = -\frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta y} - fu
        \label{eq:primitive v final}
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

\autoref{eq:primitive u final} can be split up into to parts, the $\frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta x}$ part (the gradient force) and the $fv$ part (the coriolis force). The same applies to 
\autoref{eq:primitive v final}. Effectively we have a balance between the gradient and the coriolis force as shown in \autoref{eq:pu simple} and \autoref{eq:pv simple}. The symbols in both of 
these equations are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Phi$: The geopotential, potential (more explanation in \autoref{sec:potential}) of the planet's gravity field ($Jkg^{-1}$).
    \item $x$: The change in the East direction along the planet surface ($m$).
    \item $y$: The change in the North direction along the planet surface ($m$).
    \item $f$: The coriolis parameter as described by \autoref{eq:coriolis}, where $\Omega$ is the rotation rate of the planet (for Earth $7.2921 \cdot 10^{-5}$) ($rad \ s^{-1}$) and $\theta$ is the 
    latitude \cite{coriolis}.
    \item $u$: The velocity in the latitude ($ms^{-1}$).
    \item $v$: The velocity in the longitude ($ms^{-1}$).
\end{itemize}

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        f = 2\Omega\sin(\theta)
        \label{eq:coriolis}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta x} = fv
        \label{eq:pu simple}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta y} = -fu
        \label{eq:pv simple}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\delta p}{\rho \delta x} = fv
        \label{eq:pu simple final}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\delta p}{\rho \delta y} = -fu
        \label{eq:pv simple final}
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Since we want to know how the atmosphere moves, we want to get the v and u components of the velocity vector (since $v$ and $u$ are the veolicites in longitude and latitude, if we combine them 
in a vector we get the direction of the overall velocity). So it is time to start coding and calculating! If we look back at \autoref{alg:stream1v2}, we can see that we already have a double 
for loop. In computer science, having multiple loops is generally considered a bad coding practice as you usually can just reuse the indices of the already existing loop, so you do not need to 
create a new one. However this is a special case, since we are calculating new temperatures in the double for loop. If we then also would start to calculate the velocities then we would use new 
information and old information at the same time. Since at index $i - 1$ the new temperature has already been calculated, but at the index $i + 1$ the old one is still there. So in order to fix 
that we need a second double for loop to ensure that we always use the new temperatures. We display this specific loop in \autoref{alg:stream2}. Do note that everything in \autoref{alg:stream1v2} 
is still defined and can still be used, but since we want to focus on the new code, we leave out the old code to keep it concise and to prevent clutter.

    \For{$lat \in [-nlat, nlat]$}{
        \For{$lon \in [0, nlon]$}{
            $u[lat, lon] \leftarrow -\frac{p[lat + 1, lon] - p[lat - 1, lon]}{\delta y} \cdot \frac{1}{f[lat]\rho}$ \;
            $v[lat, lon] \leftarrow \frac{p[lat, lon + 1] - p[lat, lon - 1]}{\delta x[lat]} \cdot \frac{1}{f[lat]\rho}$ \;
        }
    }

The gradient calculation is done in \autoref{alg:gradient}. For this to work, we need the circumference of the planet. Herefore we need to assume that the planet is a sphere. While that is not 
technically true, it makes little difference in practice and is good enough for our model. The equation for the circumference can be found in \autoref{eq:circumference} \cite{circumference}, 
where $r$ is the radius of the planet. Here we also use the f-plane approximation, where the coriolis paramter has one value for the northern hemisphere and one value for the southern hemisphere 
\cite{fplane}.

\begin{equation}
    2 \pi r
    \label{eq:circumference}
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}
    \SetAlgoLined
    $C \leftarrow 2\pi R$ \;
    $\delta y \leftarrow \frac{C}{nlat}$ \;

    \For{$lat \in [-nlat, nlat]$}{
        $\delta x[lat] \leftarrow \delta y \cos(lat \cdot \frac{\pi}{180})$ \;

        \eIf{$lat < 0$}{
            $f[lat] \leftarrow -10^{-4}$ \;
        }{
            $f[lat] \leftarrow 10^{-4}$ \;
        }
    }

\end{algorithm}

Because of the geometry of the planet and the construction of the longitude latitude grid, we run into some problems when calculating the gradient. Since the planet is not flat ("controversial 
I know"\cite{simon}) whenever we reach the end of the longitude we need to loop around to get to the right spot to calculate the gradients (as the planet does not stop at the end of the 
longitude line but loops around). So to fix that we use the modulus (mod) function which does the looping for us if we exceed the grid's boundaries. We do haveanother problem though, the poles. 
As the latitude grows closer to the poles, they are converging on the center point of the pole. Looping around there is much more difficult so to fix it, we just do not consider that center 
point in the main loop. The changed algorithm can be found in \autoref{alg:stream2v2}

\begin{algorithm}[hbt]
    \SetAlgoLined
    \For{$lat \in [-nlat + 1, nlat - 1]$}{
        \For{$lon \in [0, nlon]$}{
            $u[lat, lon] \leftarrow -\frac{p[(lat + 1) \text{ mod } nlat, lon] - p[(lat -1) \text{ mod } nlat, lon]}{\delta y} \cdot \frac{1}{f[lat]\rho}$ \;
            $v[lat, lon] \leftarrow \frac{p[lat, (lon + 1) \text{ mod } nlon] - p[lat, (lon -1) \text{ mod } nlon]}{\delta x[lat]} \cdot \frac{1}{f[lat]\rho}$ \;
        }
    }

    \label{alg:stream2v2}
\end{algorithm}

Do note that the pressure calculation is done between the temperature calculation in \autoref{alg:stream1v2} and the $u, v$ calculations in \autoref{alg:stream2v2}. At this point our model shows
a symmetric vortex around the sun that moves with the sun. This is not very realistic as you usually have convection and air flowing from warm to cold, but we do not have that complexity yet 
(due to our single layer atmosphere).
