\subsection{Potential} \label{sec:potential}
Potential is the energy change that occurs when the position of an object changes \cite{potential}. There are many potentials, like electric potential, gravitational potential and elastic 
potential. Let me explain the concept with an example. Say you are walking on a set of stairs in the upwards direction. As your muscles move to bring you one step upwards, energy that is used
by your muscles is converted into gravitational potential. Now imagine you turn around and go downwards instead. Notice how that is easier? That is due to the gravitational potential being 
converted back into energy so your muscles have to deliver less energy to get you down. The potential is usually tied to a force, like the gravitational force.
